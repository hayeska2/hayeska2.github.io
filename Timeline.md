## *Monday 18th February 2019*
The very first class of Project 1 for the semester. We all gathered and met the tutors that were
involved in the various projects. It was announced that I would be the volunteering coordinator
and would be overseeing the students in project for volunteering. I would also be overseeing
the volunteering website as well. I was nervous as I had not done a lot with my web knowledge
but was determined to step outside my comfort zone.

Today i was tasked with removing the ICT helpdesk content off the template and adding a skeleton of what the new volunteering page
would look like. As in my previous post I mentioned that I had not done a lot with web but once I started I actually enjoyed it
and felt like I had really achieved a lot.
