The very first class of Project 1 for the semester. We all gathered and met the tutors that were
involved in the various projects. It was announced that I would be the volunteering coordinator
and would be overseeing the students in project for volunteering. I would also be overseeing
the volunteering website as well. I was nervous as I had not done a lot with my web knowledge
but was determined to step outside my comfort zone.
